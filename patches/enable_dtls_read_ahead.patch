Subject: Fix DTLS when used with patched OpenSSL
Bug: https://issues.asterisk.org/jira/browse/ASTERISK-24711

A recent security fix for OpenSSL broke DTLS negotiation for many
applications. This was caused by read ahead not being enabled when it
should be. While a commit has gone into OpenSSL to force read ahead
on for DTLS it may take some time for a release to be made and the
change to be present in distributions (if at all). As enabling read
ahead is a simple one line change this commit does that and fixes
the issue.
